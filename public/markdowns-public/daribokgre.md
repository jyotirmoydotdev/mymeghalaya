Daribokgre offers a breathtaking escape into the heart of Meghalaya's natural beauty, with stunning views, vibrant plantations, and a gateway to the Nokrek Biosphere Reserve. As the starting point for the famous Nokrek Peak trek, Daribokgre immerses visitors in the rich traditions and diverse ecosystems of the Garo Hills. While exploring the area, it's essential to follow the rules set by the Daribokgre Management Society. Visitors are urged to respect the environment by not littering, refraining from picking the precious orchids and Memang Narang oranges, and maintaining the tranquility of the forest by keeping noise to a minimum. A local guide is required for mountain treks, ensuring both safety and a deeper understanding of the area. While Daribokgre is a place of unparalleled beauty, it's also a place of respectâ€”both for nature and the local community. Failure to adhere to these guidelines can result in a fine, so visitors are encouraged to enjoy the serenity and splendor of Daribokgre while preserving its pristine condition for future generations.
