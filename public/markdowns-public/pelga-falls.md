Pelga Falls, located just 12 kilometers northwest of Tura town in Meghalaya, is a majestic waterfall that offers a serene escape into nature. Known for its wide stone cliffs and a picturesque hanging bamboo bridge, the falls provide an enchanting experience, especially during the winter months when the water is clear. Although the approach road is rough, and you may need to walk the final stretch, the journey is well worth it. Visitors are treated to stunning views from two observation points, with the lower one offering a magical sensation of water droplets gently misting the air. While it's a popular spot for picnics and soft adventure activities like angling, caution is advised due to the strong currents and slippery rocks. The site remains largely unspoiled, maintaining its natural beauty, though littering has become an issue. It's a must-visit destination for those looking to immerse themselves in the tranquil and scenic surroundings of Tura.
