    about: "South West Garo Hills, an administrative district in Meghalaya, India, was officially upgraded to a full-fledged district on August 7, 2012, with its headquarters at Ampati. This milestone was marked by an inauguration by Dr. Mukul Sangma, then Chief Minister of Meghalaya. The district was carved out of West Garo Hills and includes villages from the Betasing and Zikzak Community and Rural Development Blocks, along with others from surrounding blocks like Selsella and Gambeggre. These reorganized villages fall under new Gram Sevak Circles to streamline local administration.\n\nThe reorganization of Gram Sevak Circles ensured that most villages, except for those under Dalu Block, are now part of the Betasing Community and Rural Development Block. As of the 2011 Census, the population of South West Garo Hills stands at 172,495, with a near-equal male-to-female ratio. The district's literacy rate is 56.7%. The majority of the population belongs to Scheduled Tribes (80.10%), with a small Scheduled Caste community (1.21%). Christianity dominates the region, followed by Hinduism and Islam.\n\nGaro is the most widely spoken language, with 51.14% of the district's population speaking it. Bengali, Hajong, and Koch are also significant minority languages, spoken by 26.43%, 16.46%, and 5.48% of the population, respectively. Garo, spoken by over 88,000 people, is followed by Bengali with 45,586 speakers, Hajong with 31,523, and Koch with over 10,000 speakers.",

    about: "West Garo Hills, located in the westernmost part of Meghalaya, is an administrative district with Tura as its headquarters. The district spans an area of 3,714 kmÂ² and, as of 2011, had a population of 643,291, making it the second most populous district in the state after East Khasi Hills. The district is bordered by East Garo Hills to the east, South Garo Hills to the southeast, Assam's Goalpara district to the north and northwest, and Bangladesh to the south. The region is rich in cultural diversity, with a population primarily consisting of the Garo community, alongside significant Bengali, Assamese, Nepali, and other ethnic groups.\n\nThe history of West Garo Hills dates back to October 22, 1976, when the larger Garo Hills district was split into East and West Garo Hills. Further administrative changes occurred in 1992 when West Garo Hills was divided again to form South Garo Hills. In 2012, the Ampati Civil Sub-Division was elevated to a full district, known as South West Garo Hills. Despite these developments, West Garo Hills remains one of India's 250 most backward districts, receiving financial support from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme to boost development.\n\nThe district's population is linguistically diverse, with Garo (A'chik) being the most spoken language, followed by Bengali and smaller languages like Hajong, Koch, and Assamese. The district's literacy rate stands at 68.38%, with a sex ratio of 979 females for every 1,000 males. Tura, the district's main town, has a vibrant mix of ethnic groups, including the Garos, Bengalis, Assamese, and smaller communities like the Hajong, Rabhas, and South Indians, contributing to the region's rich cultural tapestry.",

    about: "North Garo Hills, an administrative district in Meghalaya, India, was carved out of the East Garo Hills district to enhance public convenience and governance. With Resubelpara as its headquarters, the district spans an area of 1,113 square kilometers and had a population of 118,325 as of 2001. Strategically located in the northernmost part of the Garo Hills, it serves as a gateway to the region, sharing borders with Assam and other districts in Meghalaya. The district's population is a diverse mix of indigenous Garo tribes along with minor communities such as Rabhas, Hajongs, Kacharis, and Boros, reflecting an ethnic blend of Indo-Burmese-Tibetan ancestry.\n\nResubelpara has a rich administrative history, dating back to 1952 when it was first established as a Development Block. Over the years, it gradually evolved into a significant administrative unit, attaining full district status in 2012 under the leadership of Dr. Mukul Sangma, the then Chief Minister of Meghalaya. The district's geographical boundaries are shaped by neighboring Assam to the north and east, while to the west lies West Garo Hills and to the south, East Garo Hills. The district enjoys a subtropical climate with abundant rainfall, contributing to its lush greenery and agrarian lifestyle.\n\nAgriculture is the backbone of North Garo Hills, with nearly 90% of the population depending on it for livelihood. Rice, along with other staples like yam, millet, maize, and pulses, forms the primary crop. Horticulture is also a flourishing sector, with fruits such as oranges, pineapples, and jackfruits being prominent. Plantation crops like areca nut, cashew, and rubber are cultivated alongside floriculture, which has seen growing interest in the region. While agriculture dominates the economy, small-scale industries such as sericulture, dairy farming, and carpentry are also emerging, presenting significant potential for development in food processing and agro-based industries.",

    about: "The East Garo Hills district was established in 1976 as part of a reorganization of the larger Garo Hills district in Meghalaya, aimed at improving administrative access for the local population. The district's headquarters, Williamnagar, is named after Captain Williamson A. Sangma, the first Chief Minister of Meghalaya. Located on the plains along the Simsang River, Williamnagar holds historical significance, as it was near here in 1837 that the Garos made their last major stand against British forces. The heroic Garo leader, Pa Togan Nengminja Sangma, was killed in a skirmish at Chisobibra, close to the present-day town.\n\nWilliamnagar serves as the administrative center of East Garo Hills, which spans 2,603 square kilometers. According to the 2011 census, the district has a population of 317,917, comparable to that of the Bahamas. With a population density of 122 inhabitants per square kilometer, East Garo Hills experienced a growth rate of 26.75% over the decade from 2001 to 2011. The district boasts a sex ratio of 968 females for every 1,000 males and a literacy rate of 75.51%. The local languages include A'Tong, a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by approximately 10,000 people in both India and Bangladesh.\n\nEast Garo Hills is also home to rich biodiversity, with Nokrek National Park, established in 1986, as one of its key natural reserves. The park, which covers an area of 47 square kilometers, is shared with the neighboring South and West Garo Hills districts. Nokrek is known for its pristine landscapes and serves as a sanctuary for various wildlife species, contributing to the district's importance as a center for conservation efforts. The district's lush flora and fauna, coupled with its historical and cultural heritage, make it a unique part of Meghalaya.",

Its headquarters is located in Nongstoin, and the district spans a vast area of 5,247 square kilometers. According to the 2011 census, the district has a population of 383,461, which is comparable to the population of the Maldives. The population density is 73 inhabitants per square kilometer, and the district has a growth rate of 30.25% over the decade 2001-2011. The sex ratio is 980 females for every 1,000 males, with a literacy rate of 77.87%.\n\nThe district is predominantly inhabited by the Khasi tribe, known for its matrilineal system of inheritance and social structure. However, the Garo tribe also has a significant presence in the Mawshynrut region of West Khasi Hills. While traditional customs have been maintained, the Khasi society has seen significant transformations in recent times, particularly due to the adoption of Western lifestyles among the educated population. This blend of modernity and tradition adds to the cultural richness of the region.\n\nGeographically, West Khasi Hills is characterized by its scenic landscapes, rolling hills, and deep gorges. The district is known for its natural beauty and plays a crucial role in Meghalaya's cultural and ecological landscape. The road connectivity across the district is generally good, linking Nongstoin to other parts of the state, though many interior villages still face transportation challenges. Despite these difficulties, the district's unique culture and natural charm continue to make it a significant part of Meghalaya's diverse heritage.",

    about: "Eastern West Khasi Hills, one of the newest districts in Meghalaya, was created in 2021 after the bifurcation of West Khasi Hills. Located just 25 kilometers from the state capital, Shillong, its headquarters is the town of Mairang. The district covers 1,356.77 square kilometers, which constitutes 6% of the state's area. It is home to a population of 131,451, according to the 2011 census. Bordered by several other districts, including Ri Bhoi to the north and South West Khasi Hills to the south, Eastern West Khasi Hills is a geographically diverse region with deep historical and cultural roots.\n\nThe district is known for its stunning natural features, such as the Mawthadraishan Range, which runs through its center, and the iconic Kyllang Rock. Mawthadraishan Peak, rising to 1,924.5 meters, is the highest point in the district. Kyllang Rock, a massive granitic dome, is steeped in Khasi folklore and regarded as a mystical figure in the local legends. The central highlands of the district serve as a natural divide between the Brahmaputra River basin to the north and the Meghna River basin to the south. Major rivers like the Kynshi and Khri, along with their tributaries, flow through the region, adding to its scenic beauty and ecological importance.\n\nRich in history, Eastern West Khasi Hills played a significant role during the Anglo-Khasi War, with Tirot Sing, the leader of the Khasi resistance, hailing from this area. A memorial in Mairang commemorates his bravery and leadership. Today, the district remains predominantly inhabited by the Khasi people, who practice a vibrant culture while sustaining their agricultural traditions of growing paddy rice, maize, and potatoes. National Highway 106 links the district to Shillong and Nongstoin, while other state highways connect it to neighboring regions, ensuring the district remains connected and accessible.",

    about: "Southwest Khasi Hills, carved out of the West Khasi Hills district on August 3, 2012, is a relatively new administrative district in Meghalaya. Its headquarters is located at Mawkyrwat, and the district spans an area of 1,341 square kilometers. The district comprises villages from two Community & Rural Development BlocksâRanikor and Mawkyrwatâas well as 18 additional villages from the Nongstoin block. The region's strategic boundaries include West Khasi Hills to the north and west, East Khasi Hills to the east, and the international border with Bangladesh to the south.\n\nHistorically, the district has deep cultural roots tied to the Khasi people, one of the earliest ethnic groups in the Indian subcontinent, belonging to the Proto-Austroloid Mon-Khmer race. The Khasi society, with its matrilineal system, continues to follow traditional customs while adapting to modern influences. The Khasis are divided into various subgroups, including the War-Khasis, who inhabit the southern part of the district, and the Lyngngams in the northwest. Traditional attire, such as the 'Jymphong' for men and elaborate female dress, is still worn during ceremonial occasions, preserving the region's cultural identity.\n\nThe social structure of the Khasis is unique, with descent traced through the mother, but the father playing a crucial role in the family's material and mental well-being. Inheritance follows the matrilineal system, with the youngest daughter, or 'Ka Khadduh,' inheriting ancestral property. While many Khasis have adopted Christianity, traditional religious beliefs in a Supreme Creator and nature deities still hold significance in certain communities. The cultural richness of the region is reflected in its customs, festivals, and social practices, which continue to shape the identity of the district.",

    about: "Ri Bhoi is a captivating administrative district in Meghalaya, India, known for its rugged terrain and unique geographical features. Nestled approximately 53 kilometers from Shillong and 50 kilometers from Guwahati, the district covers an area of 2,378 square kilometers. Established as a full-fledged district on June 4, 1992, Ri Bhoi was carved from the East Khasi Hills. Despite its expansive size, it remains one of the least populous districts in Meghalaya, with a population of 258,840 as of the 2011 census. This relatively low population density adds to the district's tranquil charm.\n\nThe landscape of Ri Bhoi is characterized by a series of hill ranges that gradually descend into the Brahmaputra Valley. The district is dotted with significant rivers, including the Umtrew, Umsiang, Umran, and Umiam, which add to its natural beauty. The region's diverse topography, from rugged hills to lush river valleys, contributes to its ecological richness. Notably, the Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary, established in 1981, covers 29 square kilometers and serves as a haven for local wildlife.\n\nRi Bhoi is also notable for its connectivity and infrastructure. It boasts the only airport in Meghalaya, located at Umroi, and is well-linked by National Highway No. 37, which connects to Shillong and beyond. The district's strategic location makes it a vital junction for travel to Assam, Mizoram, and other northeastern states. With a population density of 109 inhabitants per square kilometer and a literacy rate of 77.22%, Ri Bhoi reflects a blend of traditional tribal culture and modern connectivity, making it a unique and important part of Meghalaya.",

    about: "East Khasi Hills, a vibrant administrative district in the Indian state of Meghalaya, is a picturesque area where the bustling town of Shillong serves as its headquarters. With an expanse of 2,748 square kilometers and a population of 825,922 as of the 2011 census, it stands as the most populous of Meghalaya's 12 districts. Established on October 28, 1976, when the original Khasi Hills district was divided into East and West Khasi Hills, it further expanded on June 4, 1992, to also include Ri-Bhoi District.\n\nThe district's geographical landscape is a stunning mix of rolling grasslands, deep gorges, and verdant plateaus. It stretches from the serene Shillong Plateau, known for its breathtaking vistas, to the dramatic ravines of Mawsynram and Shella-Bholaganj that border Bangladesh. Among its notable features is Shillong Peak, the highest point in the district, offering panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. The climate ranges from temperate in the highlands to tropical in the lower regions, with the southwest monsoon bringing substantial rainfall from May to September.\n\nEast Khasi Hills is also renowned for its cultural richness and natural beauty. It is home to the unique whistled language of Kongthong village and the awe-inspiring Kynrem Falls. Mawlynnong village, recognized for its exceptional cleanliness, has garnered accolades as one of Asia's cleanest villages. The district's attractions include Nohkalikai Falls, one of India's tallest waterfalls, and Umiam Lake, a serene spot just outside Shillong. The well-connected Shillong, with major roads leading to Guwahati and Silchar, serves as a gateway to these enchanting sites, though interior village connectivity remains a challenge.",

    about: "West Jaintia Hills, an administrative district in Meghalaya, India, emerged from the bifurcation of the former Jaintia Hills District on July 31, 2012. Covering an area of 1,693 square kilometers, this district is a land of diverse landscapes and significant natural resources. With Jowai as its headquarters, West Jaintia Hills serves as a hub for governmental offices, educational institutions, and healthcare facilities. The district's boundaries stretch north to Assam, south to Bangladesh and East Jaintia Hills, east to Assam, and west to East Khasi Hills, placing it strategically in the heart of Meghalaya.\n\nDespite its rich agricultural heritage, the district is notably influenced by its mineral wealth. The region is known for its abundant limestone deposits, which have given rise to several cement factories, especially in East Jaintia Hills. Coal mining is also a major activity, with significant operations in Lad Rymbai, although most of the mining sites have now shifted to East Jaintia Hills. Agriculture remains a crucial aspect of life here, with the Lakadong turmericârecognized for its exceptional curcumin contentâbeing a standout product. This turmeric has gained national attention and is under consideration for a Geographical Indication tag.\n\nWest Jaintia Hills is characterized by its rugged terrain and limited transportation options, relying predominantly on roadways. Major highways such as NH 40 and NH 44 connect the district to surrounding areas. The district's demographic profile, with a population density of 159.69 per square kilometer, is predominantly comprised of Scheduled Tribes, who speak various dialects including Pnar, War, and Khasi. Among its notable sites are the towering monoliths in Nartiang, the serene Thadlaskein Lake, and the impressive Krangshuri Falls. Educational institutions, while not extensive, include reputable colleges and schools in Jowai, Khliehriat, and Nongtalang, contributing to the district's growth and development.",

    about: "East Jaintia Hills, established on July 31, 2012, is a vibrant district in Meghalaya, India, with Khliehriat serving as its administrative headquarters. Carved from the former Jaintia Hills District, this region spans an area of 2,115 square kilometers and is renowned for its scenic beauty and rich cultural heritage. The district is bordered by Assam to the north, south, and east, while West Jaintia Hills lies to the west. Khliehriat, which transitioned from an administrative unit in 1976 to a civil sub-division in 1982, eventually became the district headquarters in 2012, providing a central hub for governance and development.\n\nThe district's population of 122,939 predominantly includes the Pnar (also known as Jaintia), Khynriam, and Biate tribes. Scheduled Tribes make up 96.11% of this population, with Pnar being the most widely spoken language. East Jaintia Hills is divided into two Community and Rural Development Blocks: Khliehriat and Saipung. This administrative setup ensures effective local governance and development, addressing the needs of its diverse communities.\n\nGeographically, East Jaintia Hills is situated in the easternmost part of Meghalaya, with an altitude of about 1,200 meters above sea level. The region enjoys a humid subtropical monsoon climate, experiencing significant rainfall from mid-May to September, followed by cooler, drier conditions in the winter. The district is rich in natural resources, including coal and limestone, which contribute to its economic activities. Agriculture thrives here with rice as the primary crop, complemented by the cultivation of betel-nut, betel-leaves, potatoes, and various spices. The district also boasts essential infrastructure, with National Highway 44 connecting it to Shillong and the eastern parts of Assam, facilitating regional connectivity and growth.",
