Known for its wide stone cliffs and a picturesque hanging bamboo bridge, the falls provide an enchanting experience, especially during the winter months when the water is clear. Although the approach road is rough, and you may need to walk the final stretch, the journey is well worth it. Visitors are treated to stunning views from two observation points, with the lower one offering a magical sensation of water droplets gently misting the air. While it's a popular spot for picnics and soft adventure activities like angling, caution is advised due to the strong currents and slippery rocks. The site remains largely unspoiled, maintaining its natural beauty, though littering has become an issue. It's a must-visit destination for those looking to immerse themselves in the tranquil and scenic surroundings of Tura.",

As the starting point for the famous Nokrek Peak trek, Daribokgre immerses visitors in the rich traditions and diverse ecosystems of the Garo Hills. While exploring the area, it's essential to follow the rules set by the Daribokgre Management Society. Visitors are urged to respect the environment by not littering, refraining from picking the precious orchids and Memang Narang oranges, and maintaining the tranquility of the forest by keeping noise to a minimum. A local guide is required for mountain treks, ensuring both safety and a deeper understanding of the area. While Daribokgre is a place of unparalleled beauty, it's also a place of respect—both for nature and the local community. Failure to adhere to these guidelines can result in a fine, so visitors are encouraged to enjoy the serenity and splendor of Daribokgre while preserving its pristine condition for future generations.",
