Carved from Assam on January 21, 1972, it comprises the United Khasi, Jaintia Hills, and Garo Hills. Covering an area of 22,429 square kilometers, Meghalaya is home to over 3.2 million people, with its capital, Shillong, often dubbed the 'Scotland of the East' by the British due to its lush landscapes and misty hills."}

One of the wettest places on earth, Meghalaya's southern Khasi Hills record an astounding 12,000 mm of rainfall annually. Over 70% of the state is covered in forests, renowned for their rich biodiversity of flora and fauna."}

Predominantly agrarian, the state grows crops like potatoes, rice, pineapples, and spices, while also having a notable commercial forestry sector. Though rich in minerals, Meghalaya lacks major industries but serves as a key trading hub with Bangladesh."}

The state's landscape is dominated by ancient Archean rock formations that house valuable minerals like coal, limestone, uranium, and sillimanite. Rivers crisscross the region, with many carving deep gorges and creating stunning waterfalls, particularly in the Khasi Hills. The state's highest point, Shillong Peak, rises to 1,961 meters, offering sweeping views over its capital, Shillong.

Human habitation in the region dates back to the Neolithic period, with ancient sites discovered in the Khasi and Garo Hills. The practice of jhum or shifting cultivation, still common in the area, hints at the agricultural traditions of these early settlers. The region's highland plateaus, blessed with fertile soil and abundant rainfall, provided an ideal environment for human settlement and possibly even the domestication of rice. According to the theory of archaeologist Ian Glover, Northeast India, including Meghalaya, could be the birthplace of domesticated rice, given its extraordinary diversity of rice species."}

However, scholars debate its effectiveness, as civil society is often constrained by both government policies, like the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), and local insurgent activities, complicating its role in regional development and peacebuilding.
